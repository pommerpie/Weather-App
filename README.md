# Weather-App
Module 6's challenge was to make an app that will show the current weather, as well a 5 day forecast. The forecast shows the temperature, humidity, and wind speeds. It also shows an icon displaying what the weather will look like.

You can choose from a preset list of cities to see the weather forecast, or you can search a city using the search bar.
